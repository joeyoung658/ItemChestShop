## How do I sell items?

In order to sell items, you must set up what’s known as a chest shop.

Make sign, and place it on the chest (can be on the front, sides or ontop)
On the sign, write in the following format:<br />
[Quantity of Selling Item]<br />
[Selling Item]<br /> 
[Quantity of Currency]<br />
[Currency]<br />
So if I want to sell 64 Red Sand for 4 diamonds, I would do this;

NOTE: all items must be written in capital letters and any items sold must be written in the format given on the item when advance tooltips are enabled and the item is hovered over in your inventory.
EXAMPLE:
The item “Raw Mutton” is actually called “mutton”. If you wrote “RAW_MUTTON” on your chest-shop, it wouldn’t work. But if you wrote “MUTTON”, it would.

To enable advanced tooltips, simple press F3 + H.

Finally, place the item you are selling into the chest. Leave some room for the item you are going to be receiving when someone buys your item(s) (so in my case, I would leave room for Diamonds).

And that’s it! Your chest-shop is set up, and you’re ready to scam kids make insane business deals!

## How do I buy items?
Simply go into somebody’s shop, and right-click a sign on a chest. Make sure you have enough of the item that they’re buying it for (The RED part of the sign)
